Welcome to the nitro-protocol state channels documentation site. Here you will find documentation that accompanies our smart contracts ([hosted on github](https://github.com/statechannels/monorepo/tree/master/packages/nitro-protocol/contracts)), which implement a state channel protocol outlined in the [nitro white paper](https://magmo.com/nitro-protocol.pdf).

The website featurs a low level, autogenerated [API reference](../api/contract-inheritance.md) for the contracts, as well as this more loquacious section featuring explanations and tutorials.
